2.Problem Statement / Objectives:<br>
  i.To save water and reduce human intervention in the agriculture field.<br>
  ii.To get output of soli water sensor and provide water to crop.<br>
<br><br>
3.Personas of the System:<br>
  i.The intention of our project is to help farmers to monitor their crops in an efficient way.<br>
  ii.They can have a control on their crops in the absence of their presence in the feild itself.<br>
  iii.They will get to know about the various features like moisture content,humidity as well as temperature level present across their crops.<br>
<br><br>

4. Architecture:<br>
